# LorenzosBBREAK is a Breakout/Arkanoid clone game made in pygame.
It's my first solo project after a year and a half of coding vids and tuts.
Also big thanks to Pyguru as well check him out on youtube!
Also big thanks to the Dafluffypotato too, check him out on youtube!
This game was coded using Pydroid3 IDLE kn Android.There are no graphics just basic shapes and animations.
To play tap the side of the screen you wish for the paddle to move.
Hopefully this can help another someday.
